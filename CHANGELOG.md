# Changelog

## 1.0.2

**Fixes**

- Using aliases in the `SoqlQuery::select()` would cause a 400 error ([#7](https://github.com/allejo/PhpSoda/issues/7))
- Add support for new array structure in `SoqlQuery::select()` for those using Symfony's YAML component ([#7](https://github.com/allejo/PhpSoda/issues/7))

**Changes**

- Added deprecation notices for upcoming changes in 2.0.0 of the library
  - `SodaDataset::getDataset()` has been renamed to `SodaDataset::getData()`
  - OAuth2 support will be dropped. Guzzle 6 will be used in 2.0.0 to be PSR-7 compliant and in turn, OAuth2 support should be configured through a custom Guzzle client.

## 1.0.1

**Changes**

- Enforce TLS 1.2, per [Socrata's announcement](https://github.com/allejo/PhpSoda/commit/63d01d48b51a6a20b0e29fcf1c5f739d78c21aa3)

## 1.0.0

**Fixes**

- SoQL queries with aggregate functions no longer fail

**Changes**

- A standard **SoqlQuery** no longer automatically selects `:id` and sorts in ascending order
- Dropped support for PHP 5.3, 5.4, 5.5 due to [Socrata's new SNI requirement](https://dev.socrata.com/changelog/2016/08/24/sni-now-required-for-https-connections.html)
- Add support for `SoqlQuery::having()`
- phpDoc links in SoQL have been updated to Socrata's new URL patterns

## 0.1.3

**Changes**

- Remove limit of 50,000 in the SoqlQuery::limit(); older datasets will simply throw an exception with an error message stating the limit.
- API 2.0 and 2.1 datasets can now be differentiated with SodaDataset::getApiVersion()
